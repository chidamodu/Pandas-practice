df['new_column_name'] = df.groupby('cn')['cn'].transform('count')#Groupby column 'cn' and the second 'cn' is what I count on using transform. Transform returns the count values which will be broadcasted to all the rows in the group. The result is then stored in a new column by name: 'new_column_name'
